- retrieve data start time (defult now), can select future date and time to start
- data retrieving periods and cycle duration (defult 1 hour cycle time, running 24 hours, 7 days a week)
- data retrieving end time (defult 1 week, options for days, weeks, months, until requested stop)
- navigation type (defult: driving, can we walking, transit, etc)
- route preferences, (defult: fastest route determined by google maps at the time of the data retrieve, options for avoiding highways, tolls, etc, )
- additional routing (yes or no, and can generate data collection for potential different routes)

when retireving data
- use google maps api
- get all possible useful routes based on inputs, maybe a couple is fine
- get route details (roads and turns to take)
- get route time, distance
- get traffic areas, and zones
- store all this data somewhere

live portal
- see current status of data retrieving
- have graphic and data interpretors showing the results of collected data

End results portal section
- shows all results including but not limited to
    - the different routes-
    - the different route time it takes with a timeline showing all retrieved data
